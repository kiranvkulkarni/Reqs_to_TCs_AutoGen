Feature: Camera Flash Mode Toggle and Battery Warning Behavior

  Scenario: User toggles flash mode and sees visual feedback
    Given the camera app is open in Photo mode
    When the user taps the flash icon (red dot indicator) on the control bar
    Then the flash mode should cycle to the next state (Off → Auto → On → Off...)
    And the flash icon should visually update to reflect the current mode (e.g., icon color or symbol change)
    And the UI should remain stable without layout shifts

  Scenario: User selects Flash Auto and device is in low-light condition
    Given the camera app is open and the current flash mode is Auto
    And the ambient light sensor detects dim lighting (simulated condition)
    When the user taps the shutter button to capture a photo
    Then the flash should automatically fire
    And the flash icon should display a yellow highlight (as per design legend) to indicate Auto activation

  Scenario: User selects Flash Off in dim lighting and sees warning message
    Given the camera app is open and the current flash mode is Off
    And the ambient light sensor detects dim lighting
    When the user taps the flash icon to toggle mode
    Then the flash mode should remain Off
    And a warning message “Flash Off & Dim condition” should appear in the top status bar
    And the message should be displayed in both English and Korean as per design legend

  Scenario: Battery is low and user attempts to use Flash On
    Given the device battery level is below 15%
    And the user has selected Flash On mode
    When the user taps the shutter button to take a photo
    Then a warning message “Battery too low to use Flash” should appear in the top status bar
    And the flash should not fire
    And the flash mode should automatically revert to Flash Auto or Flash Off (as per business logic in design
note #3)

  Scenario: User cycles through flash modes and returns to initial state
    Given the camera app is open and flash mode is initially Off
    When the user taps the flash icon three times consecutively
    Then the flash mode should return to Off
    And the UI should reflect the Off state consistently across all visual indicators

  Scenario: Flash mode persists after app backgrounding and foregrounding
    Given the user has set flash mode to Auto
    When the user backgrounds the app and then returns to it
    Then the flash mode should remain set to Auto
    And no visual or functional regression should occur

  Scenario: Responsive layout maintains control bar integrity on screen rotation
    Given the camera app is open in portrait mode with Flash On selected
    When the user rotates the device to landscape mode
    Then the control bar (including flash icon, shutter, mode selector) should reposition correctly without
overlap or truncation
    And the flash icon should remain tappable and visually consistent with portrait layout

  Scenario: Decision diamond logic for Flash Auto behavior
    Given the camera app is in Flash Auto mode
    And the user is in a well-lit environment
    When the user taps the shutter button
    Then the flash should not fire
    And no warning message should appear
    But if the user enters a dim environment and taps the shutter
    Then the flash should fire and a yellow highlight should appear on the flash icon

  Scenario: User sees multilingual warning messages based on system language
    Given the system language is set to Korean
    And the user triggers a battery low warning while using Flash On
    When the warning message appears
    Then it should display “배터리가 부족하여 플래시를 사용할 수 없습니다” (Korean translation)
    And if the system language is English, it should display “Battery too low to use Flash”

  Scenario: Visual hierarchy preserves flash icon prominence during state changes
    Given the user is in any camera mode (Portrait, Photo, Video, More)
    When the user toggles flash mode
    Then the flash icon should remain visually prominent in the control bar
    And its position should not shift relative to other controls (shutter, mode selector, settings)
    And all icons should maintain consistent spacing and alignment

  Scenario: User navigates through flash modes with accessibility enabled
    Given accessibility features (e.g., screen reader) are active
    When the user taps the flash icon
    Then the screen reader should announce the current flash mode (e.g., “Flash Off”, “Flash Auto”, “Flash On”)
    And the visual state change should be synchronized with the audio feedback

  Scenario: Flash mode selection persists across camera mode switches
    Given the user has set flash mode to On in Photo mode
    When the user switches to Video mode
    Then the flash mode should remain On (if supported in Video mode)
    Or revert to a default compatible mode (e.g., Auto) with a subtle UI indicator if On is not supported
    And the user should be able to toggle back to Photo mode and retain the last selected flash mode

  Scenario: Error state recovery after battery warning
    Given the user saw “Battery too low to use Flash” warning
    And the user charges the device to above 15%
    When the user reopens the camera app and selects Flash On
    Then the flash should function normally
    And the warning message should no longer appear
    And the flash icon should reflect active On state without visual degradation
